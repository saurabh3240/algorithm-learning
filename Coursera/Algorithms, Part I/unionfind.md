UNION FIND

- Interesting 
- weighted quick-union(WQUPC) find with path compression
  -  complexity with N nodes and M queries 
  - C(N+M log*n) very close to linear
  - log*n(2^655356) nearly 5 almost constant
  - thus is very slowly growing to log(N)

application

- prims 
- percolation problem
